Macaw Glassmorphic Icon Set (Corrected)
- Source: macaw glassmorphic artwork (turquoise/teal/ocean blue/coral), not phone mockups
- iOS and watchOS AppIcon.appiconset folders with Contents.json
- PNG, sRGB, opaque (no alpha)
Usage: Drag the AppIcon.appiconset folders into your project's .xcassets and set as the App Icon.
